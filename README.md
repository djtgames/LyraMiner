# LyraMiner: A Custom Python and C++-Based Cryptocurrency Miner For MintME

**LyraMiner** is a custom-built cryptocurrency miner designed to mine **MintMe** using the **Lyra2 Webchain** hashing algorithm. This lightweight Python miner connects to a Stratum-compatible mining pool, retrieves mining jobs, and uses the Lyra2 Webchain algorithm to hash the data. If the miner finds a valid share that meets the pool's difficulty target, it submits the result back to the pool for potential rewards.

## Key Features:
- **Stratum Pool Integration**: LyraMiner supports communication with Stratum-based mining pools using JSON-RPC for submitting work and requesting mining jobs.
- **Lyra2 Webchain Algorithm**: The miner uses the Lyra2 Webchain hashing algorithm (currently implemented as a placeholder using SHA-256, but can be replaced with the actual Lyra2 Webchain algorithm).
- **Efficient Mining Loop**: LyraMiner continuously requests new jobs from the pool, processes them, and submits the results, maximizing uptime and efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Users can configure pool URL, username, and password directly within the script for seamless mining on supported pools.
